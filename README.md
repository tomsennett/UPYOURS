### Basic Setup

Define functions within the `UPYOURS` object, keyed by CSS selectors:

```javascript
UPYOURS[".myClass"] = function() {
  // This code runs every frame for each element with the class 'myClass'
  console.log("Updating", this);
};
```

This will automatically apply the behavior to any element with the specified class.

### Example Usage

Here are some examples demonstrating what you can achieve with UPYOURS:

- **[Calculator Example](https://tomsennett.github.io/UPYOURS/examples/calculator.html)**
- **[News Example](https://tomsennett.github.io/UPYOURS/examples/news.html)**
- **[Video Example](https://tomsennett.github.io/UPYOURS/examples/video.html)**
- **[Frogger Game Example](https://tomsennett.github.io/UPYOURS/examples/frogger.html)**

## Performance Considerations

- **Event Handling**: Each element handles its own events frame-by-frame. While this simplifies interactivity, it may lead to performance issues on pages with many elements.
- **Conflicts**: Be mindful of potential conflicts with other libraries or frameworks, especially those that also use `requestAnimationFrame`.

## Error Handling

UPYOURS includes basic error handling within its core functions, but itâ€™s recommended to implement your own error management as needed.

## Known Limitations

- **Complex Applications**: UPYOURS is not designed for large, complex applications. It excels in smaller projects where minimal setup and easy interactivity are key.

## Future Development

Currently, UPYOURS does not support custom events or extensions. Debugging is straightforward, relying on console logs and your usual debugging practices.
