# UPYOURS

**UPYOURS** (short for "Update Yourself") is a lightweight JavaScript framework that lets you define update functions for HTML elements based on CSS selectors. Simply define a function for a CSS selector, and each frame, all matching elements will run that function. The same way you can mix and match CSS styles, you can do the same with JavaScript behaviors.

UPYOURS was inspired by game development engines like Unity and GameMaker, where systems are built around a global update loop. It's designed to be simple and lightweight, with no dependencies and no configuration. Just include the upyours.js file in your HTML, define your functions, and you're good to go. You don't need to learn any new syntax or magic words, and you don't need to muck up your markup with extra classes or attributes.

Ideal use cases for UPYOURS include prototyping, small projects, simple games, and any other situation where you want to add interactivity to a web page without having to write a lot of code or set up a complex framework.

## Key Features

- **Global Update Loop**: Continuously runs a global update loop using `requestAnimationFrame`, allowing elements to execute their own update code based on their CSS classes.
- **Simple Function Binding**: Attach JavaScript behaviors directly to CSS selectors, with each element running its code based on the selectors it matches.
- **Event Handling**: Events are tracked and stored frame-by-frame, allowing you to check for event states like `this.event_keydown` or `this.event_mousemove` directly within your update loop.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To start using UPYOURS, simply include the script tag in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tomsennett/UPYOURS/upyours.js"></script>
```
### Basic Setup

Define functions within the `UPYOURS` object, keyed by CSS selectors:

```javascript
UPYOURS[".myClass"] = function() {
  // This code runs every frame for each element with the class 'myClass'
  console.log("Updating", this);
};
```

This will automatically apply the behavior to any element with the specified class.

### Example Usage

Here are some examples demonstrating what you can achieve with UPYOURS:

- **[Calculator Example](https://tomsennett.github.io/UPYOURS/examples/calculator.html)**
- **[News Example](https://tomsennett.github.io/UPYOURS/examples/news.html)**
- **[Video Example](https://tomsennett.github.io/UPYOURS/examples/video.html)**
- **[Frogger Game Example](https://tomsennett.github.io/UPYOURS/examples/frogger.html)**

## Performance Considerations

- **Event Handling**: Each element handles its own events frame-by-frame. While this simplifies interactivity, it may lead to performance issues on pages with many elements.
- **Conflicts**: Be mindful of potential conflicts with other libraries or frameworks, especially those that also use `requestAnimationFrame`.

## Error Handling

UPYOURS includes basic error handling within its core functions, but itâ€™s recommended to implement your own error management as needed.

## Known Limitations

- **Complex Applications**: UPYOURS is not designed for large, complex applications. It excels in smaller projects where minimal setup and easy interactivity are key.

## Future Development

Currently, UPYOURS does not support custom events or extensions. Debugging is straightforward, relying on console logs and your usual debugging practices.
